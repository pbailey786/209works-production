# Task ID: 51
# Title: Chamber Partnership Portal and Local Business Onboarding
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 46, 47
# Priority: high
# Description: Create Chamber Partnership Portal and Local Business Onboarding System
# Details:
This task addresses the critical missing chamber partnership flows identified in the strategic alignment review. We need to build:

1. Chamber Partnership Dashboard (/chamber) - Co-branded portal for chamber partners with member management, analytics, and joint marketing tools
2. Local Business Sign-Up Flow (/signup/local-business) - Specialized onboarding for local businesses with verification, directory lookup, and chamber member benefits
3. Chamber Partner Sign-Up (/signup/chamber-partner) - Partnership code validation, co-branded setup, and bulk account creation
4. Chamber Member Verification System - Business license checks, chamber membership validation, and compliance verification
5. Co-branded Analytics Dashboard - Partner-specific metrics, regional impact reporting, and ROI tracking

This is essential for Tasks 46.2 and 47.4 strategic alignment and represents a critical gap in our current user flow implementation.
