# Task ID: 33
# Title: Task #33: AI Prompt Engineering for 'Should I Apply' Calculator
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: low
# Description: Design and implement effective AI prompts for the 'Should I Apply' Calculator that generate meaningful qualification assessments (Not Qualified, Qualified, Over Qualified) with explanatory feedback for users.
# Details:
This task involves creating a comprehensive prompt engineering strategy for the 'Should I Apply' Calculator feature. The developer should:

1. Research effective prompt engineering techniques for classification tasks with explanatory outputs
2. Design a series of prompts that will:
   - Extract key requirements from job descriptions
   - Compare user qualifications against these requirements
   - Generate a clear qualification level assessment (Not Qualified, Qualified, Over Qualified)
   - Provide specific, actionable explanations for the assessment
3. Implement prompt templates with appropriate parameters for dynamic content insertion
4. Include guardrails to prevent biased or discriminatory assessments
5. Optimize prompts for conciseness while maintaining accuracy
6. Document the prompt strategy, including:
   - Prompt templates
   - Expected input/output formats
   - Edge case handling
   - Potential limitations
7. Coordinate with the backend team working on Task #32 to ensure compatibility with the Resume & Job Description Comparison API
8. Consider how the prompt outputs will integrate with the UI developed in Task #31

Note: While this task is not top priority, it is critical for the core functionality of the 'Should I Apply' Calculator feature.

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this task should include:

1. Unit Testing:
   - Create a test suite with sample resumes and job descriptions representing diverse scenarios
   - Verify that prompts consistently produce the expected qualification levels
   - Check that explanations are relevant and helpful across different scenarios

2. Classification Accuracy Testing:
   - Prepare a validation dataset with pre-labeled qualification assessments
   - Measure the accuracy of the prompt-based classification against human judgments
   - Aim for at least 85% agreement with human assessments

3. Explanation Quality Assessment:
   - Conduct a qualitative review of explanations for clarity and actionability
   - Ensure explanations reference specific qualifications from the resume and requirements from the job description
   - Verify explanations avoid vague or generic feedback

4. Bias Testing:
   - Test with resumes representing diverse demographics to ensure fair assessments
   - Check for consistent qualification levels across equivalent qualifications regardless of demographic factors

5. Integration Testing:
   - Verify prompts work correctly when integrated with the Resume & Job Description Comparison API
   - Ensure the UI correctly displays the qualification level and explanation

6. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Gather feedback from a small group of users on the helpfulness of the assessments
   - Iterate on prompts based on user feedback

Documentation of all test cases, results, and prompt iterations should be maintained throughout the testing process.
