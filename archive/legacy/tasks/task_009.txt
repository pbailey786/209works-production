Implemented a comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system with the following components:

1. **Permission System** (`src/lib/rbac/permissions.ts`):
   - Defined 23 granular permissions across different admin functions.
   - Created 5 admin roles: Super Admin, Content Moderator, Analytics Specialist, Marketing Manager, Support Specialist.
   - Implemented helper functions for permission checking and route access control.
   - Added backward compatibility for existing 'admin' role.

2. **React Hooks** (`src/hooks/usePermissions.ts`):
   - Created `usePermissions` hook for client-side permission checking.
   - Added convenience hooks for specific permission requirements.

3. **Permission Gate Component** (`src/components/admin/PermissionGate.tsx`):
   - Conditional rendering based on user permissions.
   - Fallback content for unauthorized access.
   - Convenience components for common permission patterns.

4. **Updated AdminSidebar** (`src/components/admin/AdminSidebar.tsx`):
   - Added permission-based navigation filtering.
   - Only shows menu items user has access to.
   - Maintains clean UI without unauthorized options.

5. **Role Management Interface** (`src/components/admin/RoleManagement.tsx`):
   - Visual role overview with statistics.
   - Permission matrix showing all roles and their permissions.
   - User role management for admin users.
   - Current user permission display.

6. **Admin Settings Page** (`src/app/admin/settings/page.tsx`):
   - Comprehensive settings interface with role management.
   - Tabbed interface for different admin functions.
   - Permission-gated access to sensitive settings.

The RBAC system follows security best practices:
- Principle of least privilege.
- Server-side permission verification.
- Granular permission control.
- Backward compatibility with existing admin role.
- Clean separation of concerns.

All UI elements now adapt based on user permissions, ensuring users only see and can access features they're authorized to use.
