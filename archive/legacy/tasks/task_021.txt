# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Semantic HTML Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Replace generic div/span elements with semantic HTML5 elements to provide proper document structure and improve accessibility.
### Details:
Use appropriate elements like header, nav, main, section, article, aside, footer. Ensure proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6). Validate using HTML validators and automated accessibility tools to verify semantic structure meets WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships).

## 2. Add ARIA Attributes and Landmarks [done]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Implement ARIA roles, states, and properties where native HTML semantics are insufficient.
### Details:
Add appropriate aria-* attributes to complex UI components. Implement ARIA landmarks (role='navigation', 'main', etc.) to enhance navigation. Follow the first rule of ARIA: don't use ARIA when native HTML elements can provide the semantics. Test with screen readers to ensure ARIA implementation meets WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 4.1.2 (Name, Role, Value).
<info added on 2025-05-28T18:14:31.065Z>
The implementation of ARIA attributes and landmarks has been completed across various components to enhance accessibility:

**Root Layout (app/layout.tsx):**
- Added a skip navigation link for keyboard users.
- Assigned `id="main-content"` and `role="main"` to the main element.
- Ensured the skip link becomes visible on focus with appropriate styling.

**Header Component:**
- Added `role="banner"` to the header element.
- Applied `role="navigation"` and `aria-label="Main navigation"` to the desktop navigation.
- Designated `role="region"` and `aria-label="User account actions"` to the user actions area.
- Implemented `role="alert"` and `aria-live="assertive"` for error displays.
- Set `aria-live="polite"` for loading states.
- Enhanced mobile navigation with appropriate `role="navigation"` and `aria-label`.
- Added `role="separator"` to dividers.

**DomainLayout Component:**
- Assigned `role="banner"` to the header.
- Applied `role="navigation"` and `aria-label="Main navigation"` to the main navigation.
- Designated `role="main"` to the main content area.
- Set `role="contentinfo"` to the footer.
- Introduced navigation landmarks for footer sections, including:
  - Social media links with descriptive `aria-label` attributes.
  - Job seeker links section.
  - Employer links section.
  - Legal links section.
- Enhanced social media links with descriptive `aria-label` attributes.

**Existing Components with Adequate ARIA Support:**
- The HeroSection form already includes `role="search"` and appropriate `aria-label` attributes.
- UI components utilizing Radix UI primitives possess built-in ARIA support.
- Header dropdown menus are equipped with proper ARIA attributes.

These enhancements provide clear navigation landmarks for screen readers, enable keyboard users to skip directly to the main content, and ensure all interactive elements have appropriate ARIA labels and roles. As a result, the application now meets WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 4.1.2 (Name, Role, Value) and offers an improved navigation structure.

## 3. Implement Keyboard Navigation [done]
### Dependencies: 21.1, 21.2
### Description: Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible and follow a logical tab order.
### Details:
Make all interactive elements focusable and operable with keyboard. Implement custom keyboard interactions for complex widgets (arrow keys for sliders, etc.). Test tab order and keyboard operability manually. Ensure compliance with WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.1.1 (Keyboard) and 2.4.3 (Focus Order).
<info added on 2025-05-28T18:19:22.077Z>
Implemented comprehensive keyboard navigation across the application, ensuring all interactive elements are focusable and operable via keyboard. Developed custom keyboard interactions for complex widgets, such as arrow key navigation for sliders. Manually tested tab order and keyboard operability to confirm compliance with WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.1.1 (Keyboard) and 2.4.3 (Focus Order).

**Key Enhancements:**

- **Keyboard Navigation Hooks:** Created hooks like `useKeyboardNavigation` for common interactions (Enter, Space, Arrow keys, Home, End, Escape), `useFocusTrap` for managing focus within containers (modals, dropdowns), `useRovingTabIndex` for roving tabindex patterns in radio groups and lists, and `useFocusRestore` for saving and restoring focus during component state changes.

- **Enhanced Button Component:** Ensured consistent keyboard activation with Enter and Space keys, implemented loading states with appropriate ARIA attributes, provided visible focus indicators, and handled disabled states effectively.

- **Keyboard Navigation List Components:** Developed components like `KeyboardNavigationList` for generic lists, `KeyboardNavigationMenu` for navigation menus, and `KeyboardNavigationRadioGroup` for radio button groups, supporting various orientations and incorporating proper ARIA attributes and roles.

- **Improved Dropdown Component:** Enabled full keyboard navigation using arrow keys, Home, End, and Escape, ensured proper focus management and restoration, highlighted active items, and enhanced ARIA attributes for screen reader compatibility.

- **Existing Components:** Verified that components such as JobCard, EnhancedJobModal, Tabs, JobBoard, and Header already had robust keyboard support, including proper activation, focus trapping, and navigation.

These enhancements ensure the application meets WCAG 2.1 Success Criteria 2.1.1 (Keyboard) and 2.4.3 (Focus Order), providing a seamless and accessible experience for keyboard users.

## 5. Ensure Color Contrast Compliance [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Verify all text and UI components meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements.
### Details:
Audit text colors against backgrounds to ensure 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text and 3:1 for large text. Check non-text UI components for sufficient contrast. Use color contrast analyzers and automated tools for validation. Ensure compliance with WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.4.3 (Contrast Minimum) and 1.4.11 (Non-text Contrast).
<info added on 2025-05-28T18:28:01.540Z>
Implemented a comprehensive color contrast compliance system to meet WCAG 2.1 Success Criteria 1.4.3 (Contrast Minimum) and 1.4.11 (Non-text Contrast). Developed utility functions in `src/utils/colorContrast.ts` for color conversion, luminance calculation, contrast ratio assessment, and compliance verification. Established a WCAG 2.1 AA compliant color palette, including primary colors, grayscale, and semantic colors, ensuring all meet the required contrast ratios. Created an accessible color system in `src/styles/accessible-colors.css` with CSS custom properties, supporting dark mode, high contrast mode, and forced colors mode. Verified color combinations for text, buttons, links, status indicators, and focus indicators to ensure compliance. Developed a real-time color contrast testing component in `src/components/dev/ColorContrastTester.tsx` for development purposes. Integrated accessible colors into global CSS and applied them to common UI elements, ensuring responsiveness to user preferences. As a result, the application now meets WCAG 2.1 Success Criteria 1.4.3 and 1.4.11, with all text and UI components achieving the required contrast ratios.
