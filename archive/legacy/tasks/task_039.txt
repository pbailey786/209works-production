# Task ID: 39
# Title: Task #39: Scaffold Responsive User Dashboard with Card-Style Widgets
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a modern, responsive user dashboard page with card-style widgets for Saved Jobs, Applications History, Alerts & Notifications, Resume Versions, and Cover Letters using Tailwind CSS for styling.
# Details:
Implementation details:

1. Create a new dashboard page component that will serve as the main container for all widgets.

2. Implement the following card-style widgets:
   - Saved Jobs: Display a summary of jobs the user has saved
   - Applications History: Show recent job applications and their status
   - Alerts & Notifications: List recent alerts and notifications
   - Resume Versions: Display different versions of user's resumes
   - Cover Letters: Show user's saved cover letters

3. Each widget should include:
   - A clear heading
   - A brief description of the widget's purpose
   - An 'Open' button that will eventually link to the full feature
   - Placeholder content that visually represents the future implementation

4. Use Tailwind CSS for styling with the following considerations:
   - Implement a responsive grid layout (consider grid-cols-1 for mobile, grid-cols-2 for tablets, grid-cols-3 for desktop)
   - Use shadow, rounded corners, and subtle hover effects for cards
   - Ensure proper spacing between widgets (gap classes)
   - Implement a consistent color scheme that matches the application's design system

5. Ensure the layout is fully responsive:
   - Desktop: Multiple columns of widgets in a grid
   - Tablet: Two columns of widgets
   - Mobile: Single column of stacked widgets

6. Add appropriate loading states and empty states for each widget.

7. Include comments in the code to indicate where future implementations will be integrated.

8. Ensure all components are accessible with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.

Note: This task is focused on creating the UI structure only. The widgets should display placeholder data and not be connected to any backend services at this stage.

# Test Strategy:
Testing Strategy:

1. Visual Testing:
   - Verify that all five widgets (Saved Jobs, Applications History, Alerts & Notifications, Resume Versions, and Cover Letters) are displayed on the dashboard
   - Confirm each widget has the required elements: heading, description, and 'Open' button
   - Ensure the styling is consistent with the application's design system
   - Check that placeholder content is visually representative of future implementation

2. Responsive Testing:
   - Test the dashboard on multiple screen sizes:
     - Desktop (1920px, 1440px, 1280px)
     - Tablet (1024px, 768px)
     - Mobile (425px, 375px, 320px)
   - Verify that the layout adjusts appropriately at each breakpoint
   - Ensure no horizontal scrolling occurs on any screen size
   - Check that text remains readable and buttons are easily clickable on all devices

3. Accessibility Testing:
   - Verify proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, etc.)
   - Check that all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
   - Ensure proper ARIA attributes are used where needed
   - Test with a screen reader to confirm all content is properly announced
   - Verify sufficient color contrast for all text elements

4. Browser Compatibility:
   - Test the dashboard in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Ensure consistent appearance and functionality across all browsers

5. Code Review:
   - Verify proper use of Tailwind CSS classes
   - Check for commented placeholders for future implementation
   - Ensure the component structure is clean and maintainable
   - Confirm that the code follows project coding standards

6. Performance Testing:
   - Check initial load time of the dashboard
   - Verify that the page renders without layout shifts

Document all test results with screenshots at various screen sizes to demonstrate responsive behavior.
