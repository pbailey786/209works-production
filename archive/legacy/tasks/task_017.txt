# Task ID: 17
# Title: Performance Optimization
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 6, 12, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement performance optimizations throughout the application to ensure fast load times and efficient operation.
# Details:
1. Implement image optimization using Next.js Image component
2. Set up caching strategies:
   - Static generation for static content
   - Incremental Static Regeneration where appropriate
   - Server-side rendering for dynamic content
   - Client-side data fetching with SWR
3. Configure Vercel KV for caching frequently accessed data
4. Implement code splitting and lazy loading
5. Optimize bundle size with proper imports
6. Set up database query optimization:
   - Review and optimize complex queries
   - Ensure proper indexing
   - Implement query caching where appropriate
7. Add performance monitoring
8. Implement resource hints (preload, prefetch)
9. Configure content delivery optimization
10. Set up response compression

# Test Strategy:
1. Measure page load times before and after optimization
2. Test Lighthouse performance scores
3. Verify Core Web Vitals metrics
4. Validate image optimization effectiveness
5. Test caching strategies with cache hits/misses
6. Measure database query performance
7. Test bundle size and loading performance
8. Validate performance under various network conditions
9. Test performance on low-end devices
