# Task ID: 28
# Title: Task #28: Homepage Redesign with Local-Focused UI and Responsive Job Card Grid
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Redesign the homepage with a modern, local-focused hero section, remove the location search functionality, and implement a responsive job card grid specifically styled for a local job board.
# Details:
1. Hero Section Redesign:
   - Create a visually appealing hero section that emphasizes local job opportunities
   - Include city/region-specific imagery or dynamic content that highlights the local focus
   - Incorporate a simplified search that focuses on job titles/keywords only (removing location search)
   - Ensure the hero section maintains brand identity while adopting modern design principles
   - Add a compelling call-to-action that encourages immediate job exploration

2. Location Search Removal:
   - Remove all location search UI elements from the homepage
   - Update the search functionality to operate without location parameters
   - Modify any backend API calls to no longer require location data
   - Update search result handling to accommodate the simplified search approach
   - Ensure proper error handling for any legacy code expecting location parameters

3. Responsive Job Card Grid:
   - Design and implement a responsive grid layout for job cards
   - Create a new job card component styled specifically for local job listings
   - Include visual indicators for job proximity or local relevance
   - Implement proper spacing and alignment that adapts to different screen sizes
   - Ensure the grid maintains proper layout on mobile, tablet, and desktop views
   - Optimize loading performance with lazy loading for job cards

4. Integration Requirements:
   - Ensure compatibility with the existing UI component library (reference Task #27)
   - Implement both light and dark mode support for all new UI elements
   - Maintain accessibility standards throughout the redesign
   - Update any relevant documentation to reflect the new homepage design

5. Technical Considerations:
   - Use CSS Grid and/or Flexbox for responsive layouts
   - Implement proper state management for job card data
   - Ensure all new components follow the project's component architecture
   - Optimize image assets for the hero section to ensure fast loading times

# Test Strategy:
1. Visual Testing:
   - Compare the implemented design against approved mockups using visual regression testing
   - Verify the hero section appears correctly across different screen sizes and resolutions
   - Confirm proper rendering in both light and dark modes
   - Validate that all UI elements maintain proper spacing and alignment

2. Functional Testing:
   - Verify the location search has been completely removed from the UI
   - Confirm the simplified search functionality works correctly with job titles/keywords
   - Test that job cards display all required information correctly
   - Validate that clicking on job cards navigates to the correct job detail page
   - Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, search fields) function as expected

3. Responsive Testing:
   - Test the homepage on multiple devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - Verify the job card grid properly adjusts to different screen sizes
   - Confirm the hero section is responsive and maintains visual appeal at all breakpoints
   - Test with various viewport sizes to ensure no layout issues occur

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure and compare page load times before and after the redesign
   - Verify lazy loading of job cards functions correctly
   - Test scrolling performance with a large number of job cards
   - Ensure hero section images load efficiently

5. Accessibility Testing:
   - Verify all new UI elements meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
   - Test keyboard navigation throughout the redesigned homepage
   - Ensure proper contrast ratios in both light and dark modes
   - Validate semantic HTML structure for screen readers

6. Cross-browser Testing:
   - Verify the redesign works correctly in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Test on both iOS and Android mobile browsers
