# Task ID: 27
# Title: Task #27: UI Component Library Documentation and Integration Guide
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive documentation and integration guides for the newly available UI components in the component library, including usage examples, API references, and dark mode implementation guidelines.
# Details:
This task involves creating detailed documentation for all 17 UI components (Button, Input, Card, Alert, Modal, Spinner, Dropdown, Tabs, Tooltip, Badge, Avatar, Table, Toast/Notification, Switch/Toggle, ProgressBar, Slider, and Stepper) that have been added to the UI component library.

For each component:
1. Create a dedicated documentation page with:
   - Component overview and purpose
   - Props/API reference with type definitions
   - Usage examples with code snippets
   - Variations and states (disabled, loading, etc.)
   - Accessibility considerations
   - Dark mode implementation specifics

2. Update the demo page to include:
   - Interactive examples of each component
   - Code snippets that can be copied
   - Dark/light mode toggle to demonstrate theme support
   - Responsive behavior demonstrations

3. Create integration guides for developers:
   - How to import and use components
   - Best practices for component composition
   - Theme customization options
   - Performance considerations
   - Migration guides for replacing existing UI elements

4. Update the main documentation index to include the new components with proper categorization and search functionality.

5. Ensure all documentation follows the project's style guide and maintains consistency with existing documentation.

The documentation should be clear enough that developers unfamiliar with the component library can quickly understand how to use these components in their projects.

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this documentation task will involve:

1. Documentation Completeness Check:
   - Verify that all 17 components have dedicated documentation pages
   - Confirm each page contains all required sections (overview, API reference, examples, etc.)
   - Ensure dark mode implementation is documented for each component

2. Technical Accuracy Verification:
   - Have 2-3 developers review the documentation for technical accuracy
   - Verify all code examples compile and work as expected
   - Test copy-paste functionality of code snippets
   - Validate that all props and methods are correctly documented

3. Integration Testing:
   - Have developers who weren't involved in component creation follow the integration guides to implement components in a test project
   - Document any confusion or difficulties encountered during this process
   - Measure time taken to successfully implement components following the documentation

4. Accessibility Review:
   - Verify documentation includes accessibility guidelines for each component
   - Test documentation itself with screen readers and other accessibility tools

5. User Experience Testing:
   - Conduct a survey with team members on documentation clarity and usefulness
   - Track metrics like time spent on documentation pages and navigation patterns
   - Collect feedback on areas of confusion or missing information

6. Search and Discoverability:
   - Test search functionality with various component-related queries
   - Verify components appear in appropriate categories and can be found through navigation

Documentation will be considered complete when all components are fully documented, all tests pass, and at least two developers have successfully implemented components in test projects using only the documentation as a guide.
