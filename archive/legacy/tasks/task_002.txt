# Task ID: 2
# Title: Database Schema and ORM Setup
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement the PostgreSQL database schema using Prisma ORM, including models for job listings, users, alerts, and advertisements.
# Details:
1. Install Prisma ORM: `npm install prisma @prisma/client`
2. Initialize Prisma: `npx prisma init`
3. Configure PostgreSQL connection in .env
4. Define Prisma schema models in schema.prisma:
   - Job model (id, title, company, description, location, salary, type, source, url, postedAt, etc.)
   - User model (id, email, name, passwordHash, createdAt, etc.)
   - Alert model (id, userId, jobTitle, location, frequency, etc.)
   - Advertisement model (id, title, businessName, imageUrl, targetUrl, zipCodes, startDate, endDate, etc.)
   - SearchHistory model (id, userId, query, filters, createdAt)
   - Subscription model (id, userId, email, zipCode, categories, etc.)
5. Define relationships between models
6. Set up indexes for frequently queried fields
7. Configure full-text search using PostgreSQL tsvector
8. Generate Prisma client: `npx prisma generate`
9. Create initial migration: `npx prisma migrate dev`

# Test Strategy:
1. Validate schema against requirements in PRD
2. Test database connection
3. Verify migrations apply successfully
4. Create test data and validate relationships
5. Test query performance for common operations
6. Verify full-text search functionality
7. Ensure indexes are properly created
