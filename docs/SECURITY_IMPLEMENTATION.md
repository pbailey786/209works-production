# 🔒 Security Implementation Guide for 209Jobs

## 🚨 Critical Security Issues Fixed

### 1. **AI Chat Endpoint Security**
**BEFORE**: Completely open endpoints that could be abused
**AFTER**: Comprehensive security with rate limiting, suspicious pattern detection, and audit logging

### 2. **User Data Protection**
**BEFORE**: Risk of exposing sensitive user data to AI services
**AFTER**: Data sanitization and field filtering before AI processing

### 3. **Database Access Control**
**BEFORE**: No Row Level Security (RLS) policies
**AFTER**: Comprehensive RLS policies protecting user data

## 🛡️ Security Measures Implemented

### AI Security Middleware (`src/lib/middleware/ai-security.ts`)

#### Features:
- **Rate Limiting**: 10 requests/minute for anonymous, 30 for authenticated users
- **Suspicious Pattern Detection**: Blocks attempts to access user data, passwords, etc.
- **Request Logging**: All AI requests are logged for monitoring
- **Data Sanitization**: Removes sensitive fields before sending to AI
- **Authentication Integration**: Optional authentication with role-based access

#### Protected Patterns:
```javascript
// These patterns are automatically blocked:
- "show me all users"
- "list all resumes" 
- "get user data"
- "admin password"
- "database"
- "sql injection"
- Personal information requests
- API key/secret requests
```

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

#### Database Security (`src/lib/database/rls-policies.sql`)

**User Table Protection:**
- Users can only see/edit their own profile
- Admins can see all users
- Employers can see basic info of applicants only

**Job Application Protection:**
- Users can only see their own applications
- Employers can only see applications for their jobs

**Search History Protection:**
- Users can only see their own search history
- Admins can see aggregated data for analytics

**Saved Jobs Protection:**
- Users can only manage their own saved jobs

### Enhanced API Security

#### Secured Endpoints:
- ✅ `/api/chat-job-search` - AI chat with security
- ✅ `/api/llm-job-search` - LLM search with protection
- ✅ `/api/users/[id]` - User profile access control
- ✅ `/api/profile` - Profile management security

#### Security Features:
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with NextAuth
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-user and per-IP limits
- **Audit Logging**: All security events logged
- **Data Filtering**: Sensitive data removed from responses
- **CSRF Protection**: For state-changing operations

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### 1. AI Chat Security

```typescript
// Example: Secured AI endpoint
export const POST = withAISecurity(
  async (req: NextRequest, context: AISecurityContext) => {
    // Your handler code here
    const sanitizedUserProfile = sanitizeUserData(userProfile);
    // Process with sanitized data only
  },
  aiSecurityConfigs.public // or .authenticated or .premium
);
```

### 2. Data Sanitization

```typescript
// Automatically removes sensitive fields:
const sanitized = sanitizeUserData(userData);
// Removes: passwordHash, twoFactorSecret, resumeUrl, phoneNumber, etc.
```

### 3. Rate Limiting

```typescript
// Different limits for different user types:
public: 10 requests/minute, 100/hour
authenticated: 30 requests/minute, 500/hour  
premium: 100 requests/minute, 2000/hour
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Apply Database Security

Run in your Supabase SQL editor:
```sql
-- Apply RLS policies
\i src/lib/database/rls-policies.sql
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Add to your `.env`:
```bash
# Security Configuration
AI_REQUEST_LOGGING_ENABLED=true
SECURITY_HEADERS_ENABLED=true
RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true

# Audit logging
AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED=true
```

### 3. Monitor Security Events

Check your `AuditLog` table for:
- `AI_CHAT_REQUEST` - All AI chat requests
- `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` - Rate limit violations
- `SUSPICIOUS_PATTERN` - Blocked suspicious requests
- `UNAUTHORIZED_ACCESS` - Authentication failures

## 📊 Security Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor:

1. **Rate Limit Violations**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "AuditLog" 
   WHERE action = 'RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED' 
   AND "createdAt" > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
   ```

2. **Suspicious Requests**
   ```sql
   SELECT details FROM "AuditLog" 
   WHERE action = 'AI_CHAT_REQUEST' 
   AND details->>'blocked' = 'true';
   ```

3. **Failed Authentication Attempts**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "AuditLog" 
   WHERE action = 'UNAUTHORIZED_ACCESS' 
   AND "createdAt" > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day';
   ```

## 🔍 Security Best Practices

### 1. Regular Security Audits
- Review audit logs weekly
- Monitor for unusual patterns
- Check rate limit violations

### 2. User Data Protection
- Never log sensitive user data
- Always sanitize data before AI processing
- Regularly review data access patterns

### 3. API Key Security
- Rotate OpenAI API keys regularly
- Monitor API usage and costs
- Set up billing alerts

### 4. Database Security
- Regularly review RLS policies
- Monitor database access patterns
- Keep Prisma and dependencies updated

## 🚨 Incident Response

### If You Detect Suspicious Activity:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Check audit logs for the user/IP
   - Temporarily block the user if necessary
   - Review what data might have been accessed

2. **Investigation:**
   - Analyze request patterns
   - Check for data exfiltration attempts
   - Review authentication logs

3. **Response:**
   - Update security rules if needed
   - Notify affected users if data was compromised
   - Document the incident

## 📞 Security Contacts

- **Database Security**: Check Supabase dashboard
- **API Security**: Monitor application logs
- **AI Security**: Review OpenAI usage dashboard

## 🔄 Regular Maintenance

### Weekly:
- Review audit logs
- Check rate limit violations
- Monitor API costs

### Monthly:
- Update security dependencies
- Review and update RLS policies
- Audit user permissions

### Quarterly:
- Full security audit
