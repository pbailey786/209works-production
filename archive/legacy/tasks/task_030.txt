# Task ID: 30
# Title: Task #30: Mobile Optimization and Accessibility Enhancements for Homepage
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Improve the homepage's mobile responsiveness and accessibility compliance by refining spacing, typography, color contrast, focus states, and ARIA attributes across all major sections.
# Details:
This task requires comprehensive improvements to the homepage's mobile experience and accessibility compliance:

1. Mobile Responsiveness:
   - Adjust spacing between elements to be proportional on smaller screens
   - Implement proper stacking order for all sections when viewed on mobile devices
   - Optimize font sizes with a responsive typography system (using rem/em units)
   - Ensure touch targets are at least 44x44px for mobile users
   - Test and fix any overflow issues on various mobile breakpoints

2. Accessibility Enhancements:
   - Improve color contrast ratios to meet WCAG AA standards (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text)
   - Add visible focus indicators for all interactive elements
   - Implement proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6) throughout the page
   - Add descriptive aria-labels to all major sections:
     * Hero section
     * Job cards container and individual cards
     * "How it works" section
     * Testimonials carousel/section
     * Call-to-action section
   - Ensure all images have appropriate alt text
   - Make sure form elements have associated labels

3. Section-Specific Improvements:
   - Hero: Ensure text remains readable at all viewport sizes
   - Job Cards: Optimize card layout for touch interfaces
   - How It Works: Ensure process steps stack properly on mobile
   - Testimonials: Implement accessible carousel controls if applicable
   - CTA: Ensure buttons meet size and contrast requirements

4. Technical Implementation:
   - Use CSS media queries for responsive adjustments
   - Implement CSS custom properties for consistent spacing and typography
   - Add appropriate semantic HTML5 elements
   - Test with screen readers to verify aria-label effectiveness

This task should align with the recent homepage redesign (Task #28) while enhancing the user experience for all users, particularly those on mobile devices or using assistive technologies.

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this task will require a multi-faceted approach to verify both mobile responsiveness and accessibility compliance:

1. Mobile Responsiveness Testing:
   - Test on actual devices representing various screen sizes (iPhone SE, iPhone 12/13, larger Android devices)
   - Use Chrome DevTools and other browser developer tools to test across multiple breakpoints
   - Verify proper spacing, stacking, and font sizing at each breakpoint
   - Conduct touch testing to ensure all interactive elements are easily tappable
   - Check for any horizontal overflow or scroll issues
   - Verify that content remains readable and properly aligned at all viewport widths

2. Accessibility Testing:
   - Run automated accessibility tests using tools like Axe, WAVE, or Lighthouse
   - Verify color contrast ratios using WebAIM's contrast checker
   - Test keyboard navigation through the entire homepage
   - Verify focus visibility on all interactive elements
   - Test with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver, JAWS) to verify:
     * Section aria-labels are properly announced
     * Interactive elements are properly identified
     * Content flow makes logical sense

3. Cross-Browser Testing:
   - Verify consistent appearance and behavior across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Test on both iOS and Android mobile browsers

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure and verify that mobile performance metrics (LCP, FID, CLS) remain within acceptable ranges
   - Ensure any added accessibility attributes don't negatively impact page load times

5. User Testing:
   - If possible, conduct testing with users who rely on assistive technologies
   - Get feedback from team members using the site on various mobile devices

6. Documentation:
   - Document all accessibility improvements made
   - Create before/after screenshots demonstrating the enhancements
   - Provide a checklist of WCAG criteria that have been addressed

The task will be considered complete when all major sections of the homepage pass both mobile responsiveness checks and meet WCAG AA accessibility standards.
