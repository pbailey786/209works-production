# Task ID: 26
# Title: Task #26: JobsPikr API Integration for Job Listings Aggregation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate the JobsPikr API to replace our custom scraping system for job listings aggregation, implementing authentication, data fetching, deduplication, and storage mechanisms.
# Details:
This task involves transitioning from our current custom web scraping solution to the JobsPikr API for job listings data. Implementation should include:

1. API Authentication:
   - Set up secure API key management for JobsPikr
   - Implement token-based authentication flow
   - Store credentials securely using environment variables

2. Data Fetching:
   - Create a service layer to handle all JobsPikr API interactions
   - Implement rate limiting and error handling for API requests
   - Set up scheduled jobs to fetch data at appropriate intervals
   - Support pagination and filtering options provided by JobsPikr

3. Data Processing:
   - Develop a data transformation layer to convert JobsPikr response format to our internal schema
   - Implement deduplication logic to prevent duplicate job listings
   - Add data validation to ensure quality and consistency
   - Create fallback mechanisms for handling API downtime

4. Storage Integration:
   - Update database schema if needed to accommodate JobsPikr data structure
   - Implement efficient batch processing for storing large volumes of job listings
   - Create indexing strategy for optimized retrieval
   - Maintain historical data during the transition period

5. Migration Strategy:
   - Develop a phased approach to transition from custom scraping to JobsPikr
   - Create a feature flag system to toggle between data sources
   - Implement logging to compare data quality between old and new systems

6. Documentation:
   - Document the API integration process
   - Update relevant system architecture diagrams
   - Create troubleshooting guides for common API issues

Consider potential impacts on existing features that rely on job listing data and ensure backward compatibility during the transition.

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this integration should be comprehensive and include:

1. Unit Testing:
   - Test authentication module with valid and invalid credentials
   - Test data transformation functions with various JobsPikr response formats
   - Test deduplication logic with different scenarios (exact duplicates, partial matches)
   - Verify error handling for API failures, timeouts, and rate limiting

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test end-to-end flow from API request to database storage
   - Verify scheduled jobs execute correctly and handle failures gracefully
   - Test data consistency between JobsPikr responses and stored data
   - Validate that all required fields are properly mapped and transformed

3. Performance Testing:
   - Benchmark API response times and optimize where necessary
   - Test system performance with large volumes of job listings
   - Verify database query performance with new data structure
   - Measure memory usage during batch processing operations

4. Comparison Testing:
   - Compare job listings data between custom scraping and JobsPikr API
   - Analyze coverage, quality, and freshness of data from both sources
   - Document any discrepancies and determine acceptable thresholds

5. Security Testing:
   - Verify API credentials are securely stored and transmitted
   - Test for potential data leakage or exposure
   - Ensure compliance with data protection regulations

6. Acceptance Criteria:
   - JobsPikr API authentication is successful
   - Job listings are fetched, deduplicated, and stored correctly
   - Data quality meets or exceeds the previous scraping system
   - System handles API downtime gracefully
   - Performance metrics are within acceptable thresholds
   - All existing features using job listing data continue to function correctly

Create a test environment with JobsPikr sandbox/test API keys before deploying to production.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement JobsPikr API Authentication System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the authentication system for JobsPikr API integration, including secure credential management and token handling.
### Details:
Create a dedicated authentication service that handles API key management, token-based authentication flow, and secure credential storage. Use environment variables for storing sensitive information. Implement token refresh mechanisms and handle authentication errors gracefully. Create a configuration file for API endpoints and other JobsPikr-specific settings.

## 2. Develop JobsPikr Data Fetching Service [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a robust service layer to handle all interactions with the JobsPikr API, including data fetching, pagination, and error handling.
### Details:
Build a service class that encapsulates all JobsPikr API calls. Implement rate limiting to stay within API constraints. Add comprehensive error handling for network issues, API downtime, and invalid responses. Support all JobsPikr filtering options and pagination. Set up scheduled jobs using cron or a job scheduler to fetch data at configurable intervals. Create retry mechanisms for failed requests with exponential backoff.

## 3. Build Data Transformation and Deduplication Layer [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a system to transform JobsPikr data format to our internal schema and implement robust deduplication logic.
### Details:
Create mapper classes to transform JobsPikr response objects to our internal job listing model. Implement validation to ensure data quality and consistency. Develop deduplication algorithms based on job title, company, location, and other relevant fields. Create a fingerprinting mechanism for job listings to facilitate quick comparison. Add logging for transformation errors and validation failures. Implement fallback mechanisms for handling missing or malformed data.

## 4. Update Storage Integration for JobsPikr Data [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modify the database schema and storage mechanisms to efficiently handle JobsPikr data structure and volume.
### Details:
Review and update the database schema to accommodate any new fields from JobsPikr. Implement batch processing for efficient storage of large volumes of job listings. Create or update indexes to optimize retrieval patterns. Develop a data archiving strategy for historical listings. Implement database migrations that preserve existing data. Create a data access layer that abstracts storage details from the rest of the application.

## 5. Implement Migration Strategy and Feature Flagging [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a phased migration approach with feature flags to safely transition from custom scraping to JobsPikr API.
### Details:
Create a feature flag system to toggle between data sources (custom scraping vs JobsPikr). Implement detailed logging to compare data quality, coverage, and performance between systems. Develop a dashboard to monitor the transition metrics. Create a rollback plan for critical failures. Implement A/B testing capabilities to serve some users with old data and others with new data. Update documentation and system architecture diagrams to reflect the new integration. Create troubleshooting guides for common API issues.
