# Task ID: 32
# Title: Task #32: Backend: Resume & Job Description Comparison API Endpoint
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: low
# Description: Create an API endpoint that accepts a user's resume and job description as inputs, then leverages an AI model to analyze compatibility and generate a match rating.
# Details:
The endpoint should be implemented as a RESTful API service that:

1. Accepts POST requests with JSON payload containing:
   - User resume (text or PDF upload converted to text)
   - Job description text
   - Optional parameters for analysis preferences

2. Integrates with an AI model (OpenAI GPT or a local LLM) to:
   - Extract key skills, experience, and qualifications from both documents
   - Compare the resume against job requirements
   - Generate a compatibility score (e.g., 0-100%)
   - Provide specific feedback on strengths and gaps

3. Returns a structured JSON response with:
   - Overall match score
   - Section-by-section analysis (skills match, experience match, etc.)
   - Specific recommendations for application improvements
   - Confidence level of the analysis

4. Implements proper error handling for:
   - Invalid input formats
   - AI service unavailability
   - Rate limiting considerations

5. Includes appropriate authentication and rate limiting to prevent abuse.

6. Optimizes for response time by implementing caching where appropriate.

7. Documents the API using OpenAPI/Swagger specifications.

Note: This task is not a top priority but should be designed with scalability in mind as it will integrate with the "Should I Apply" Calculator UI (Task #31).

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this endpoint should include:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Verify input validation logic correctly handles valid and invalid payloads
   - Test error handling for various failure scenarios
   - Mock AI service responses to test parsing and scoring logic

2. Integration Tests:
   - Test actual integration with the chosen AI model using sample resumes and job descriptions
   - Verify correct handling of AI service responses, including error cases
   - Measure and validate response times under various load conditions

3. End-to-End Tests:
   - Create a test suite with diverse resume and job description pairs
   - Validate scoring consistency and accuracy against human-evaluated baselines
   - Test integration with the "Should I Apply" Calculator UI (Task #31)

4. Performance Testing:
   - Benchmark response times with various document sizes
   - Test concurrent request handling
   - Validate rate limiting functionality

5. Security Testing:
   - Verify authentication mechanisms
   - Test for potential data leakage or privacy concerns
   - Ensure proper sanitization of inputs

6. Manual Validation:
   - Have team members submit their actual resumes against real job listings
   - Compare AI analysis with human judgment for accuracy
   - Gather feedback on the usefulness and accuracy of recommendations

Success criteria: The endpoint consistently returns accurate analysis results within 5 seconds, handles edge cases gracefully, and provides actionable feedback that aligns with human expert assessment in at least 80% of test cases.
