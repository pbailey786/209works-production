# Email Verification System Setup

## 🎉 What's Been Added

Your 209 Works platform now has a complete email verification system! Here's what's new:

### ✨ New Features
- **Email Verification Required**: Users must verify their email before accessing job applications, employer features, etc.
- **Beautiful Email Templates**: Professional verification emails with 209 Works branding
- **Password Visibility Toggle**: Eye icon to show/hide passwords on reset forms
- **Supabase Integration**: Password resets now sync with Supabase
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Expired tokens are automatically cleaned up
- **Reminder Emails**: Users get reminders 12 hours before verification expires

### 🎨 New Pages & Components
- `/verify-email` - Resend verification emails
- `PasswordInput` component with show/hide toggle
- Updated password reset pages with better UX
- Professional email templates

### 🔐 Security Features
- Verification tokens expire in 24 hours
- Secure token generation with crypto.randomBytes
- Protected routes via middleware
- Email verification required for sensitive actions

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Database Migration
After your code deploys to Netlify, you need to update your database schema:

```bash
# Run this command in your Netlify Functions or via your database provider
npx prisma db push
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in your Netlify environment:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your PostgreSQL connection string
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - For sending verification emails
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Your site URL (https://209.works)
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - JWT secret key

### 3. Test the System
1. Create a new user account
2. Check that verification email is sent
3. Click verification link
4. Try accessing protected features

## 📧 How It Works

### User Signup Flow
1. User creates account → Email verification token generated
2. Verification email sent with 24-hour expiration
3. User clicks link → Email marked as verified
4. User can now access all features

### Protected Routes
These routes now require email verification:
- `/employer/*` - All employer features
- `/admin/*` - Admin dashboard
- `/profile` - User profile
- `/applications` - Job applications
- `/saved-jobs` - Saved jobs
- `/job-alerts` - Job alerts
- `/apply/*` - Job application pages

### Email Templates
- **Verification Email**: Welcome message with verification link
- **Reminder Email**: Sent 12 hours before expiration
- **Contact Form**: Professional admin notifications

## 🛠️ Admin Features

### Verification Management
- View unverified users in admin dashboard
- Manually verify users if needed
- Monitor verification email delivery

### Email Analytics
- Track verification email open rates
- Monitor failed deliveries
- View verification completion rates

## 🔧 Maintenance

### Automatic Cleanup
The system automatically:
- Deletes expired verification tokens
- Sends reminder emails before expiration
- Logs all verification activities

### Manual Cleanup (if needed)
```javascript
// Clean up expired tokens manually
import { cleanupExpiredTokens } from '@/lib/email/verification-helpers';
await cleanupExpiredTokens();
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deploy the code** (already done!)
2. **Run database migration**: `npx prisma db push`
3. **Test verification flow** with a new account
4. **Monitor email delivery** in Resend dashboard
5. **Check admin analytics** for verification rates

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Emails not sending**: Check RESEND_API_KEY in Netlify env vars
- **Database errors**: Run `npx prisma db push` to update schema
- **Verification links broken**: Check NEXTAUTH_URL is set correctly
- **Users can't access features**: Ensure middleware is working

### Support
If you need help, the verification system includes detailed logging and error handling. Check your Netlify function logs for any issues.
