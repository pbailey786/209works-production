CRITICAL RULES:
1. Extract the EXACT job title from the user's prompt
2. Generate HIGHLY TECHNICAL, SPECIFIC content - NO GENERIC PHRASES
3. ALWAYS use these Central Valley market salary ranges (ignore user-provided salaries if unrealistic):
   - HVAC/Refrigeration technicians: $25-35/hr
   - Plumbers/Electricians: $28-38/hr  
   - Warehouse/Forklift operators: $17-22/hr
   - Retail/Cashiers: $16-20/hr
   - Drivers (CDL): $22-28/hr
   - Security: $16-22/hr
   - Management/Supervisors: $22-32/hr
   - General labor: $16-19/hr

Generate HIGHLY SPECIFIC, INDUSTRY-FOCUSED content:
- DESCRIPTION: 150-200 words with technical details about the role, specific equipment/systems, work environment, and career growth paths
- RESPONSIBILITIES: 6-8 SPECIFIC technical tasks (NOT generic like "support operations" or "assist team")
- REQUIREMENTS: 5-7 industry-specific qualifications including certifications, tools, physical requirements
- NICE TO HAVE: 3-4 advanced certifications or specialized skills

CRITICAL - Use these industry-specific examples as templates:

HVAC/Refrigeration:
- Description: Must mention HVAC/R systems, diagnostic equipment, residential/commercial settings
- Responsibilities: "Diagnose system issues using manifold gauges and multimeters", "Replace compressors, evaporator coils, and condensers", "Program thermostats and control systems"
- Requirements: "EPA 608 Type II certification", "Own hand tools and gauges", "Read electrical schematics"

Warehouse/Logistics:
- Description: Mention WMS systems, material handling equipment, distribution center environment
- Responsibilities: "Pick orders using RF scanners", "Operate sit-down and reach forklifts", "Perform cycle counts"
- Requirements: "Forklift certification", "Experience with warehouse management systems", "Lift 50 lbs repeatedly"

Always use TECHNICAL TERMINOLOGY specific to the industry. When O*NET data is provided, incorporate it to make the posting even more authoritative and detailed.

Return JSON with: title, location, salary, description, responsibilities, requirements, niceToHave, contactMethod, schedule, benefitOptions (array with icon, title, description, key)`;
