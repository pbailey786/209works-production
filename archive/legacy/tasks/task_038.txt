# Task ID: 38
# Title: Task #38: Scaffold Employer/Hiring Dashboard Experience Pages
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create placeholder pages for all employer and hiring manager experience sections with basic structure, headings, and descriptions to establish the recruitment side navigation framework and prepare for future development.
# Details:
This task involves creating basic placeholder pages for the entire employer/hiring dashboard experience, with a significant focus on the newly implemented CRM (Candidate Relationship Management) system. Each page should follow a consistent structure with the following elements:

1. Page title/heading that clearly identifies the page purpose
2. Brief description of the page's intended functionality
3. Basic layout structure with placeholder sections for future components
4. Navigation elements to connect to related pages
5. Consistent styling across all pages using the project's design system

Pages to be created include:
- Employer landing page (marketing/conversion focused)
- Authentication pages (signup, signin)
- Main dashboard (overview/analytics)
- Job management (post-job, my-jobs, job details)
- Applicant management (view/filter/sort candidates)
- AI tools (candidate matching, automated screening)
- Account management (settings, team management)
- Notifications (alerts)
- Financial pages (subscription management, billing history, payment provider integration)
- Support/information (FAQ, contact, resources, testimonials, blog)
- Legal (terms, privacy)
- Analytics (reports)
- Advanced features (referral program, bulk-upload, API access)

CRM System Pages (Now Implemented):
- Enhanced Applicants Page with status tracking, bookmarking, AI scoring
- Pipeline View (Kanban) with drag-and-drop interface
- Document Vault with AI resume scoring and job matching
- Contact Database with team management and role-based permissions

Each page should include appropriate breadcrumbs, consistent header/footer elements, and clear placeholders for dynamic content. Use wireframe-style boxes with descriptive labels for areas that will contain data visualizations, tables, or complex UI components. Include sample navigation paths between related pages to demonstrate the intended user flow.

The code should be modular with reusable components where appropriate. Comment blocks should describe the intended functionality of each section to guide future development.

Financial Pages Implementation Note: For all financial/payment pages, we will be integrating with external payment services like Stripe rather than building custom payment processing. These pages should focus on subscription management, billing history, and integrating with external payment providers, not handling credit cards or money exchange directly. The pages should include placeholders for integration points with these third-party services.

Progress Update: Significant progress has been made with the creation of a comprehensive employer layout, reusable placeholder components, and enhanced core pages. The employer experience now has a professional structure with 25+ interconnected pages showing clear navigation paths and intended functionality. The CRM system has been successfully implemented with comprehensive features including an Applicant Tracking System, Kanban Pipeline View, Document Vault with AI capabilities, and Contact Database with role management. Authentication pages (signin and signup) have been completed with comprehensive PlaceholderPage components, including form wireframes, authentication options, security features, quick actions, and navigation between pages. All account management pages (profile settings, team management, billing settings, and alerts/notifications) have been successfully implemented with detailed wireframes, form structures, quick actions, and proper navigation paths. The notifications and alerts pages have been completed with a comprehensive Notification Center at /employers/notifications and an Alerts Dashboard at /employers/alerts, both featuring rich content sections and quick actions, and are now prominently featured in the main navigation.

Financial Pages Progress: All subscription management and payment integration pages have been successfully implemented. This includes a comprehensive checkout page (/employers/checkout) with Stripe integration, order summary, payment security features, webhooks, and post-payment actions. A subscription upgrade page (/employers/upgrade) has been created with plan comparisons, feature highlights, and payment options. An enhanced credits purchase page (/employers/credits) now includes credit packages, premium add-ons, Stripe payment options, and auto-reload features. A comprehensive transactions page (/employers/transactions) provides billing history, payment method management, invoice access, Stripe transaction details, and financial analytics. Additionally, a payment integration settings page (/employers/settings/payment-integration) has been implemented for managing payment provider configurations, webhooks, callbacks, security settings, and integration monitoring. All pages properly integrate with external payment providers (primarily Stripe) while avoiding direct payment processing, and the navigation has been updated to include payment integration settings.

Support/Information Pages Progress: All four support/information pages have been successfully implemented with comprehensive placeholder content using the PlaceholderPage component. The FAQ page includes question categories, quick actions, and interactive search functionality. The Contact page features multiple support channels, contact forms, and response expectations. The Resources page provides hiring guides, best practices, templates, and industry-specific content. The Blog page includes featured articles, categories, newsletter signup, and interactive features. All pages follow established design patterns and include wireframe structures for future development.

Final Update: All remaining subtasks have been successfully completed. Legal pages (terms, privacy) have been fully implemented with comprehensive PlaceholderPage components. Advanced feature pages (referral program, bulk-upload, API access) are now complete with detailed wireframes and navigation paths. The CRM system has been enhanced with Notes & Tags management, messaging system interface, interview scheduling with calendar integration placeholders, export functionality, and Quick Actions implementation. Comprehensive testing of all page interconnections and navigation flows has been conducted, with all navigation issues fixed. All 25+ pages are properly structured and linked, creating a complete professional employer experience ready for development handoff. All financial pages have been verified to properly integrate with external payment providers.
