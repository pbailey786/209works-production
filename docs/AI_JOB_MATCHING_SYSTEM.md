# 🤖 AI Job Matching System Documentation

## Overview

The AI Job Matching System automatically scans all opted-in job seekers' resumes, scores them against featured job posts using cosine similarity, and sends personalized email alerts to high-scoring matches (80+). The system is designed to be cost-efficient and scalable using vector embeddings and background processing.

## 🎯 System Flow

```
1. Employer features job → Payment confirmed → Job marked as featured
2. AI matching queued → Background process finds matching candidates  
3. High-scoring matches (80+) get personalized emails automatically
4. Email tracking → Opens, clicks, applications tracked
5. Analytics dashboard → Employers see match quality, email performance
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Database Models

- **ResumeEmbedding**: Stores vector embeddings and extracted data from resumes
- **JobMatch**: Tracks AI similarity scores and email interactions  
- **JobProcessingQueue**: Background job queue for scalable processing

- Caches embeddings for 30+ days

#### Job Matching Service (`/src/lib/services/job-matching.ts`)
- Calculates cosine similarity between job and resume embeddings
- Scores candidates 0-100, sends emails for 80+ scores
- Generates match reasons (skills, experience, location, etc.)
- Tracks analytics and performance metrics

#### Background Job Queue (`/src/lib/services/job-queue.ts`)
- Processes featured job matching, resume embedding, email batches
- Retry logic with exponential backoff

## 🚀 Setup & Configuration

### Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# OpenAI for embeddings and resume processing
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# Resend for email sending
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
FROM_EMAIL=jobs@209works.com

# Cron job security
CRON_SECRET=your_secure_random_string

# Base URL for tracking links
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://209works.com
```

### Database Migration

Run the migration to add AI matching tables:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

Or apply the specific migration:

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Netlify Scheduled Functions

The system uses Netlify's scheduled functions to process the job queue every 5 minutes.

**netlify.toml** is already configured with:
```toml
[[plugins]]
  package = "@netlify/plugin-scheduled-functions"

[functions.process-job-queue]
  schedule = "*/5 * * * *"
```

The function is located at `/netlify/functions/process-job-queue.ts`

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Matching Configuration

Update settings in the `MatchingConfig` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO "MatchingConfig" (
  name, 
  minMatchScore, 
  maxEmailsPerDay, 
  maxEmailsPerHour, 
  batchSize
) VALUES (
  'default_featured_matching',
  80.0,  -- Minimum score to send email
  100,   -- Max emails per day
  20,    -- Max emails per hour  
  50     -- Batch size for processing
);
```

### Job Queue Settings

Modify constants in `JobQueueService`:

```typescript
private static readonly MAX_RETRIES = 3;
private static readonly RETRY_DELAYS = [5000, 15000, 60000]; // 5s, 15s, 1m
```

### Email Rate Limits

Adjust in `FeaturedJobEmailService`:

```typescript
private static readonly BATCH_SIZE = 50;
private static readonly MAX_EMAILS_PER_HOUR = 100;
private static readonly MIN_SCORE_FOR_EMAIL = 80;
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Emails not sending**: Check RESEND_API_KEY and FROM_EMAIL
2. **No matches found**: Verify users have resume embeddings processed
3. **Queue not processing**: Check Netlify scheduled function logs
4. **Low match scores**: Review job descriptions and resume quality

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check queue status
curl https://209works.com/api/admin/test-ai-matching

# Process queue manually
curl -X POST https://209works.com/api/cron/process-job-queue \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET"

# View recent queue jobs
SELECT * FROM "JobProcessingQueue" 
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC LIMIT 10;

# Check matching statistics
SELECT AVG(score), COUNT(*) FROM "JobMatch" 
WHERE "createdAt" > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';
```

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- **Resume file processing**: Parse PDFs and Word documents automatically
- **Advanced matching**: Include company culture fit and salary preferences  
- **Smart scheduling**: Send emails at optimal times based on user behavior
- **A/B testing**: Test different email templates and subject lines
- **Real-time notifications**: Push notifications for high-scoring matches
- **Candidate feedback**: Allow users to rate match quality for ML improvements

## 📈 Performance Metrics
