9. Test "Remember me" functionality across browser sessions

# Subtasks:
## 1. Authentication Library Selection and Setup [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Research, evaluate, and implement an authentication library that meets security requirements.
### Details:
Compare libraries like Passport.js, Auth0, Firebase Auth, or custom JWT implementation. Consider factors like security features, community support, documentation quality, and integration complexity. Set up the chosen library in the project environment. Document the decision process and implementation details. Test basic functionality after setup.

After evaluating various authentication options, we have decided to implement Google authentication with email magic link as our primary authentication method. This approach provides a balance of security, user convenience, and implementation efficiency.

Implementation requirements:
1. Set up Google OAuth credentials in the Google Developer Console
   - Create a new project (if not already done)
   - Configure the OAuth consent screen
   - Generate OAuth 2.0 client ID and client secret
   - Add authorized redirect URIs for our application

2. Configure environment variables
   - Add Google OAuth client ID and secret to the .env file
   - Include any other required configuration parameters for the magic link functionality

3. Implement the authentication flow
   - Google OAuth sign-in button integration
   - Email magic link generation and verification process
   - Session management after successful authentication

4. Security considerations
   - Implement proper token validation
   - Set appropriate token expiration times
   - Ensure secure storage of user credentials

This authentication setup must be completed and thoroughly tested before the application launch. Documentation should be updated to reflect this implementation decision.

## 2. User Registration Flow Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create a secure user registration system with validation and data storage.
### Details:
Implement form validation for username, email, and password (with strength requirements). Add CSRF protection. Create database schema for user data. Implement password hashing using bcrypt or similar. Add rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks. Write unit tests for validation logic and integration tests for the registration flow.

NOTE: The 'role' field in user registration is currently set using the string literal 'user' instead of the UserRole enum from Prisma due to persistent type issues. This should be revisited and fixed once the Prisma client correctly generates the enum and field types.

## 3. Login System Development [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Build a secure login system with proper error handling and security measures.
### Details:
Implement login form with validation. Create authentication endpoints. Add brute force protection with account lockout after failed attempts. Implement secure session creation. Add CSRF protection. Log authentication attempts for security auditing. Test login flow with valid and invalid credentials. Ensure proper error messages that don't leak sensitive information.

## 4. Password Reset Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Implement a secure password reset flow with token-based verification.
### Details:
Create password reset request form. Implement secure token generation with expiration. Set up email delivery for reset links. Create password reset confirmation page. Add rate limiting for reset requests. Implement token validation and password update logic. Test the complete flow including token expiration and validation. Document security considerations.

## 5. Email Verification System [done]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Develop an email verification system for new user accounts.
### Details:
Implement verification token generation. Set up email delivery service integration. Create verification email template. Build verification confirmation endpoint. Add account status tracking in database. Implement UI indicators for unverified accounts. Test verification flow including token expiration. Consider resend verification functionality.

## 6. Protected Route Middleware [done]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Create middleware to protect routes based on authentication status.
### Details:
Implement authentication check middleware. Create redirect logic for unauthenticated users. Add session validation. Implement token verification for API routes. Create test cases for protected and public routes. Document middleware usage for other developers. Consider handling expired sessions gracefully.

## 7. Role-Based Access Control Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 3.6
### Description: Develop a role-based access control system for different user types.
### Details:
Define role schema and hierarchy (e.g., admin, moderator, user). Implement role assignment during registration and by admins. Create permission-based middleware. Add role verification to protected routes. Implement UI changes based on user roles. Test access control with different user roles. Document role capabilities for product team.

NOTE: Currently, the 'role' field is set using string literals instead of the UserRole enum from Prisma due to type issues. This implementation should be updated once the Prisma client correctly generates the enum and field types.

## 8. Two-Factor Authentication for Admins [done]
### Dependencies: 3.3, 3.7
### Description: Implement 2FA for administrative accounts using TOTP or similar methods.
### Details:
Research and select 2FA library (like Speakeasy). Implement TOTP generation and QR code display. Create 2FA setup flow for admin users. Build 2FA verification during login. Add backup codes generation and management. Implement 2FA bypass for account recovery. Test the complete 2FA workflow. Document the recovery process.

## 9. Session Management Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Develop comprehensive session handling with security features.
### Details:
Implement secure session storage. Add session expiration and renewal logic. Create session invalidation on logout. Implement device tracking for active sessions. Add concurrent session management. Create session revocation functionality. Test session timeout and renewal. Implement IP change detection for additional security.

## 10. User Profile Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.3
### Description: Create user profile management with secure update capabilities.
### Details:
Implement profile data retrieval. Create profile edit form and validation. Add secure password change functionality. Implement email change with verification. Create account deletion option with confirmation. Add profile picture upload with validation. Test profile updates and security measures. Ensure proper authorization checks for profile actions.

## 11. Fix UserRole Enum Type Issues [done]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.7
### Description: Resolve the type issues with the UserRole enum from Prisma in the user registration and role management.
### Details:
Investigate why the Prisma client is not correctly generating the UserRole enum types. Review Prisma schema definition for the role field. Check if there are any issues with Prisma client generation or configuration. Update the user registration and role management code to use the proper UserRole enum once the type issues are resolved. Test the changes to ensure roles are properly assigned and validated. Update documentation to reflect the proper usage of UserRole enum.
