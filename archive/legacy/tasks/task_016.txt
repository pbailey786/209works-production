4. Validate authentication middleware
5. Test pagination with various page sizes
6. Verify search and filtering functionality
7. Test caching effectiveness
8. Validate server actions for form submissions
9. Test API performance under load

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design RESTful API Structure [done]

### Description: Develop the complete set of API routes for job-related operations including listing, creation, updating, deletion, and specialized job actions.
### Details:
Create endpoints for: GET /api/jobs (with filtering), GET /api/jobs/:id, POST /api/jobs, PUT /api/jobs/:id, DELETE /api/jobs/:id, and specialized endpoints like POST /api/jobs/:id/apply. Implement proper authorization checks. Ensure efficient query performance with appropriate indexes. Include field selection and expansion options.

## 3. Implement User API Routes [done]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Develop the complete set of API routes for user management, profiles, preferences, and user-specific actions.
### Details:
Create endpoints for: GET /api/users/:id, PUT /api/users/:id, GET /api/users/:id/jobs (saved/applied jobs), POST /api/users/:id/preferences. Implement proper data sanitization. Ensure PII protection. Include role-based access controls. Consider implementing ETag support for profile updates.

## 4. Implement Alert and Ad API Routes [done]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Develop API routes for managing job alerts and advertisement placements/tracking.
### Details:
Create endpoints for: GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/alerts, GET/POST /api/ads, GET /api/ads/stats. Implement frequency controls for alerts. Ensure ad impression and click tracking. Add targeting parameters for ad delivery. Include conversion tracking endpoints. Implement proper rate limiting for ad-related endpoints.

## 5. Implement Server Actions for Forms [done]
### Dependencies: 16.2, 16.3
### Description: Create server actions to handle form submissions for job applications, user registrations, contact forms, and other interactive elements.
### Details:
Implement server actions for: job application submission, user registration/profile updates, alert creation, contact form submission. Include CSRF protection. Add file upload handling for resumes/portfolios. Implement progressive enhancement for JS-disabled clients. Ensure proper validation and sanitization.

## 6. Implement API Middleware [done]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Develop middleware for authentication, rate limiting, logging, and other cross-cutting concerns.
### Details:
Create middleware for: JWT validation, API key authentication, rate limiting (by IP and user), request logging, response compression. Implement tiered rate limiting based on user roles. Add request ID generation for traceability. Include performance monitoring. Configure CORS policies appropriately.

## 7. Implement Request Validation and Error Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 16.2, 16.3, 16.5
### Description: Create a robust validation and error handling system for all API routes and server actions.
### Details:
Implement schema validation using Zod/Joi. Create standardized error response format. Add detailed validation for complex objects. Implement proper HTTP status code selection. Create centralized error logging. Add support for i18n in error messages. Ensure sensitive information is never leaked in error responses.

## 8. Implement Caching and Pagination Strategies [done]
### Dependencies: 16.2, 16.3
### Description: Develop caching mechanisms and pagination support for all list-based API endpoints.
### Details:
Implement Redis/memory caching for frequently accessed resources. Add cache headers (ETag, Cache-Control). Create cursor-based pagination for large collections. Implement limit/offset pagination as fallback. Add cache invalidation triggers. Support partial response caching. Ensure cache keys consider all query parameters.

## 9. Implement Search and Filter Endpoints [done]
### Dependencies: 16.2, 16.3, 16.8
### Description: Create specialized search endpoints with advanced filtering, sorting, and relevance features.
### Details:
Implement full-text search for jobs and users. Add geolocation-based search. Support complex filtering with multiple parameters. Implement faceted search capabilities. Add sorting options. Ensure search performance with proper indexing. Consider implementing typeahead/autocomplete API endpoints.

## 10. Create API Documentation [done]
### Dependencies: 16.1, 16.2, 16.3, 16.5, 16.6, 16.7, 16.8, 16.9
### Description: Develop comprehensive API documentation including reference guides, examples, and security information.
### Details:
Generate OpenAPI/Swagger documentation. Create usage examples for common scenarios. Document rate limiting policies. Add authentication guides. Include performance best practices. Document error codes and resolution steps. Create SDK examples in popular languages. Implement an API explorer/playground.

## 11. Apply Validation System to Remaining Endpoints [done]
### Dependencies: 16.7
### Description: Extend the implemented validation and error handling system to all remaining API endpoints and server actions.
### Details:
Apply the Zod validation schemas to alert and ad API routes. Ensure all server actions use the centralized error handling system. Update any remaining endpoints to use standardized error responses. Verify proper HTTP status codes are used consistently across all endpoints. Test the validation system with edge cases for all endpoints.

## 12. Document Validation and Error Handling System [done]
### Dependencies: 16.7
### Description: Create internal documentation for the validation and error handling system to ensure consistent implementation across the team.
### Details:
Document the custom error classes and their use cases. Create examples of implementing Zod schemas for new endpoints. Document the middleware wrapper pattern. Create a reference guide for HTTP status code usage. Provide examples of handling common error scenarios. Include documentation on how to extend the system for future requirements.
