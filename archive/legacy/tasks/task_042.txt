# Task ID: 42
# Title: Task #42: Implement À La Carte Add-ons for Pricing System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement a flexible à la carte add-on system for the existing pricing structure, allowing users to select and purchase additional features beyond their base pricing tier.
# Details:
This task requires a comprehensive approach across multiple system components:

1. **Add-on Structure Design**:
   - Define a data model for add-ons with properties like id, name, description, price, features enabled, compatibility with pricing tiers, etc.
   - Establish rules for add-on dependencies and exclusivity (e.g., which add-ons can be combined)
   - Create a categorization system for organizing add-ons by functionality

2. **Pricing Model Updates**:
   - Extend the existing pricing model to support base tier + add-ons calculation
   - Implement logic to handle prorated billing for mid-cycle add-on purchases
   - Update the subscription management system to track active add-ons per user/account
   - Ensure proper handling of add-on changes during tier upgrades/downgrades

3. **UI Implementation**:
   - Add an "Add-ons" section to the pricing/subscription pages
   - Design an intuitive interface for browsing, selecting, and managing add-ons
   - Implement real-time price calculation as users select/deselect add-ons
   - Add visual indicators for add-on compatibility with different pricing tiers
   - Create a summary view showing selected add-ons and total cost

4. **Billing Integration**:
   - Update the billing system to itemize add-ons on invoices
   - Implement the necessary payment processing logic for add-on purchases
   - Handle add-on billing cycles in alignment with the main subscription

5. **Feature Access Control**:
   - Modify the permissions/feature-flag system to check for add-on entitlements
   - Implement graceful UI handling when users attempt to access features they haven't purchased
   - Create a system for managing temporary add-on access (trials, promotions)

6. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update user-facing documentation to explain the add-on system
   - Create internal documentation for the technical implementation
   - Update pricing pages to clearly communicate add-on options and benefits

The implementation should be modular to allow easy addition of new add-ons in the future without significant code changes.

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this feature should be comprehensive across all affected components:

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Test add-on data model validation
   - Verify pricing calculation logic with various combinations of tiers and add-ons
   - Test compatibility rules between add-ons and pricing tiers
   - Verify proration calculations for mid-cycle changes

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test the full flow from add-on selection to billing
   - Verify that the subscription management system correctly tracks active add-ons
   - Test add-on changes during tier upgrades/downgrades
   - Verify that the billing system correctly itemizes and charges for add-ons

3. **UI Testing**:
   - Verify that add-ons display correctly on pricing pages
   - Test the add-on selection interface across different devices and screen sizes
   - Verify that real-time price calculations update correctly
   - Test accessibility of the add-on selection interface

4. **Feature Access Testing**:
   - Verify that users can access features included in their purchased add-ons
   - Test that users cannot access features from add-ons they haven't purchased
   - Verify that temporary access (trials, promotions) works correctly

5. **User Acceptance Testing**:
   - Create test scenarios for common user journeys:
     - Adding an add-on to an existing subscription
     - Removing an add-on
     - Upgrading a tier with existing add-ons
   - Gather feedback on the clarity and usability of the add-on selection interface

6. **Documentation Testing**:
   - Review all updated documentation for accuracy and clarity
   - Verify that pricing information is consistent across all user-facing materials
   - Test any interactive elements in the documentation

7. **Performance Testing**:
   - Test system performance with a large number of available add-ons
   - Verify that add-on selection doesn't impact page load times significantly

8. **A/B Testing**:
   - Consider implementing A/B testing for different add-on presentation approaches to optimize conversion
