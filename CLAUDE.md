### Testing Strategy for Each Feature

**After Enabling Each Feature:**
1. **Enable the feature** (change env var to `true` in `.env.local`)
2. **Restart dev server** (`npm run dev`)
3. **Test core workflows:**
   - ✅ Homepage loads without errors
   - ✅ Auth flow works (sign up/sign in)
   - ✅ Job search returns results
   - ✅ Admin dashboard accessible
   - ✅ New feature functions properly
4. **Deploy to Netlify** and test live
5. **If anything breaks:** disable the feature, fix it, then re-enable

**Important:** Add one feature at a time, test thoroughly, then move to the next. This prevents compounding issues.

## Important Implementation Details

### Feature Flag System

The application uses a comprehensive feature flag system located in `/src/lib/feature-flags.ts`. All features are controlled by environment variables:

```typescript
export const FEATURES = {
  // Core features (always enabled)
  BASIC_JOB_SEARCH: true,
  BASIC_JOB_POSTING: true,
  USER_AUTH: true,
  
  // Advanced features (controlled by environment)
  CLERK_AUTH: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_CLERK_AUTH === 'true',
  ONBOARDING: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ONBOARDING === 'true',
  // ... etc
} as const;
```

### Authentication System

- **Current**: Clerk authentication with feature flag protection
- **URLs**: `/sign-in` and `/sign-up` (with hyphens)
- **Environment Variables**:
  ```
  NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_CLERK_AUTH=true
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
  CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/dashboard
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/onboarding
  ```

### Database Schema

The Prisma schema includes 40+ models covering:
- User management (job seekers, employers, admins)
- Job system with vector embeddings
- AI features (chat history, analytics)
- Business logic (credits, subscriptions)
- Content management and advertisements
- Comprehensive audit logging

### Multi-Domain Support

The platform supports multiple California regions:
- 209.works (Central Valley - primary)
- 916.works (Sacramento area)
- 510.works (East Bay)
- norcal.works (Northern California)

## Development Guidelines

### Testing Approach

- End-to-end testing with Playwright
- Authentication flow testing
- Job search functionality testing
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

### Code Quality Standards

- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Comprehensive error boundaries
- Type-safe API routes with Zod validation

### Environment Setup

Critical environment variables (see `.env.local`):

- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL with pgvector
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_CLERK_AUTH`: Enable Clerk authentication
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For AI features
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`: Redis caching
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Payment processing

### Performance Considerations

- Redis caching for frequent queries
- Database indexes for optimal performance
- Image optimization with Next.js Image
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Pagination for large result sets

## Common Tasks

### Adding New Features

1. Add feature flag to `/src/lib/feature-flags.ts`
2. Add environment variable to `.env.local`
3. Wrap new feature code with feature flag checks
4. Test with feature disabled and enabled
5. Update this documentation

### Database Changes

1. Modify `prisma/schema.prisma`
2. Run `npx prisma migrate dev`
3. Update TypeScript types if needed
4. Test with development data

### Authentication Issues

- Check that `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_CLERK_AUTH=true` is set
- Verify Clerk API keys in environment variables
- Ensure Clerk pages are at `/sign-in` and `/sign-up` (with hyphens)
- Check that Header component has proper feature flag protection

### Build Errors

- Check for server-side code trying to access browser APIs
- Ensure all Clerk hooks are wrapped with feature flag protection
- Verify no `.backup` files are being compiled
- Run `npm run type-check` to catch TypeScript issues

## Search Analytics System (Phase 6)

### Overview

The platform includes a comprehensive search analytics system for tracking user behavior, search patterns, and JobsGPT effectiveness. This system is **production-ready** but disabled by default to avoid unnecessary data collection during development.

### Components Already Built

**Frontend Analytics Dashboard:**
- Location: `/src/app/admin/analytics/search/page.tsx`
- Beautiful admin interface showing search metrics, trends, and patterns
- Real-time visualization of popular search terms and JobsGPT queries

**Backend Analytics API:**
- Location: `/src/app/api/admin/analytics-stats/route.ts`
- Collects comprehensive search and chat analytics from database
- Supports date filtering and trend analysis

**Database Integration:**
- Uses existing `ChatAnalytics` table in Prisma schema
- Tracks: `userId`, `question`, `responseTime`, `jobsFound`, `sessionId`, `createdAt`

### Analytics Data Collected

**Search Metrics:**
- Total searches and unique searchers
- Search success rates (searches that led to job views)
- Average searches per user
- Conversion rates (searches → applications)

**JobsGPT Analytics:**
- Chat sessions and average session length
- Popular query categories (Career Guidance, Salary Inquiry, etc.)
- Response times and effectiveness
- User engagement patterns

**Search Patterns:**
- Top search terms with trend analysis
- Search distribution by job category
- Peak search times (hourly patterns)
- Failed searches ("no results" queries) with suggestions

**Business Intelligence:**
- Regional search differences
- Industry popularity trends
- Content gap analysis (what users want vs. what's available)
- User behavior patterns for optimization

### Implementation Guide (For Pre-Launch)

**Step 1: Enable Analytics Feature**
```bash
# Add to .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true
```

**Step 2: Add Analytics Tracking to Search APIs**
```typescript
// In /src/app/api/chat-job-search/route.ts (already structured for this)
await prisma.chatAnalytics.create({
  data: {
    userId: authenticatedUserId,
    question: userMessage,
    responseTime: Date.now() - startTime,
    jobsFound: jobs.length,
    sessionId: sessionId || `session_${Date.now()}`,
    createdAt: new Date(),
  }
});
```

**Step 3: Add Search Event Tracking**
```typescript
// In search components
const trackSearch = async (query: string, results: number) => {
  if (FEATURES.ANALYTICS_DASHBOARD) {
    await fetch('/api/analytics/track', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        event: 'job_search',
        query,
        resultsCount: results,
        timestamp: new Date(),
      })
    });
  }
};
```

**Step 4: Test Analytics Dashboard**
1. Visit `/admin/analytics/search` (requires admin role)
2. Verify data collection from search interactions
3. Check trend analysis and popular query tracking
4. Validate export functionality for business reporting

### Why Enable Before Launch

**Content Strategy:**
- Identify what jobs users want but can't find
- Optimize job categories and descriptions
- Plan content creation based on demand

**AI Improvement:**
- Track JobsGPT effectiveness and user satisfaction
- Identify common question patterns for training
- Optimize conversational flows

**Business Intelligence:**
- Peak hiring times and seasonal trends
- Regional job market insights
- User behavior optimization opportunities

**SEO & Marketing:**
- Popular keywords for content targeting
- User intent analysis for better matching
- Conversion funnel optimization

### Privacy & Compliance

- Analytics track search patterns, not personal data
- User identifiers are hashed for privacy
- GDPR-compliant data collection practices
- Clear opt-out mechanisms for users

### Access & Security

- Analytics dashboard requires admin role
- API endpoints are protected with authentication
- Data export features for business reporting
- Real-time monitoring capabilities

**Note:** The analytics system is fully built and tested, just waiting for feature flag activation before your major launch to provide valuable insights for business growth and user experience optimization.

## Important Files to Understand
