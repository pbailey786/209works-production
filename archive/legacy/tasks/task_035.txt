# Task ID: 35
# Title: Task #35: Profile Integration for 'Should I Apply' Calculator
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement functionality to access and utilize resumes stored in user profiles for the 'Should I Apply' Calculator, eliminating the need for users to re-upload their resumes when using the calculator.
# Details:
This task involves modifying both the frontend and backend components of the 'Should I Apply' Calculator to integrate with the user profile system:

1. Backend Implementation:
   - Create an API endpoint to fetch the most recent resume from a user's profile
   - Implement permission checks to ensure proper authorization for resume access
   - Modify the existing comparison API endpoint to accept a user ID parameter as an alternative to direct resume upload
   - Add error handling for cases where a user doesn't have a resume in their profile

2. Frontend Implementation:
   - Add a toggle or option in the calculator UI allowing users to choose between uploading a resume or using one from their profile
   - Implement a dropdown or selection mechanism if multiple resumes exist in the profile
   - Display a preview or confirmation of which resume will be used for the comparison
   - Add appropriate messaging for users without resumes in their profiles
   - Ensure the UI clearly indicates when a profile resume is being used versus a newly uploaded one

3. Integration Considerations:
   - Ensure backward compatibility with the existing direct upload functionality
   - Implement proper loading states during resume retrieval from profiles
   - Consider caching mechanisms to improve performance for repeated calculations

Note: This task is not marked as high priority but should be implemented with attention to user experience and data security.

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this feature should be comprehensive across multiple dimensions:

1. Unit Testing:
   - Test the new API endpoint for fetching resumes from profiles
   - Verify proper error handling when profiles don't contain resumes
   - Test the modified comparison endpoint with both direct uploads and profile-sourced resumes

2. Integration Testing:
   - Verify the complete flow from UI selection through backend processing
   - Test scenarios with multiple resumes in a profile
   - Test with various user permission levels
   - Verify proper handling of edge cases (no resume, corrupted resume files, etc.)

3. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Create test scenarios for users with and without existing profile resumes
   - Verify the UI clearly indicates which resume is being used
   - Test the user experience of switching between upload and profile options
   - Ensure performance is acceptable when retrieving resumes from profiles

4. Security Testing:
   - Verify that users cannot access resumes from other user profiles
   - Test authentication requirements for accessing profile data
   - Ensure proper data handling and protection throughout the process

5. Regression Testing:
   - Verify that existing calculator functionality works correctly with direct uploads
   - Ensure other profile features are unaffected by these changes

Documentation of test results should include screenshots of the UI flow and detailed logs of API responses for various test scenarios.
