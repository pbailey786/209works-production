# Task ID: 29
# Title: Task #29: Implement Branded Footer with Voodoo Rodeo Ownership and Contact Information
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement a branded footer for the homepage that displays Voodoo Rodeo ownership information, a local jobs tagline, and contact/social media links, styled consistently with the site's theme.
# Details:
The implementation should include:

1. Create a responsive footer component that spans the full width of the homepage.
2. Include the following content sections:
   - Voodoo Rodeo ownership statement (e.g., "Â© 2023 Voodoo Rodeo, Inc.")
   - A compelling tagline emphasizing the local jobs focus (e.g., "Connecting local talent with local opportunities")
   - Contact information including email address and phone number
   - Social media links with appropriate icons (at minimum: LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook)
   - Optional: Newsletter signup form

3. Technical implementation:
   - Use the existing component library and styling system to maintain consistency with the site theme
   - Ensure the footer is responsive across all device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - Implement proper semantic HTML5 elements (footer, nav, etc.)
   - Add appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
   - Ensure all links have proper hover states and focus indicators

4. Design considerations:
   - Match the color scheme, typography, and visual style of the recently redesigned homepage
   - Use appropriate spacing between elements
   - Consider a subtle background color or border to separate the footer from the main content
   - Ensure text has sufficient contrast for readability

5. Integration requirements:
   - The footer should be implemented as a reusable component that can be added to other pages later
   - Social media links should be configurable through environment variables or CMS
   - Contact information should be stored in a central configuration to facilitate updates

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the visual appearance and functionality of the footer:

1. Visual testing:
   - Compare the implemented footer against design mockups or specifications
   - Verify the footer matches the site's theme (colors, typography, spacing)
   - Test responsiveness across multiple device sizes:
     * Mobile (320px, 375px, 414px widths)
     * Tablet (768px width)
     * Desktop (1024px, 1440px, 1920px widths)
   - Verify proper alignment and spacing of all elements
   - Ensure text is readable with sufficient contrast (use WCAG contrast checker)

2. Functional testing:
   - Verify all links are correctly implemented and point to the appropriate destinations
   - Test that social media icons display properly and link to the correct profiles
   - Ensure all interactive elements have appropriate hover/focus states
   - Test keyboard navigation through all interactive elements

3. Accessibility testing:
   - Run automated accessibility tests (Lighthouse, axe, etc.)
   - Verify proper semantic HTML structure
   - Test with screen readers to ensure all content is properly announced
   - Verify all interactive elements are keyboard accessible

4. Cross-browser testing:
   - Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Verify consistent appearance and functionality across browsers

5. Integration testing:
   - Verify the footer displays correctly on the homepage
   - Check that it doesn't interfere with other page elements
   - Ensure it loads properly and doesn't impact page performance (measure load times)

Document all test results with screenshots for visual reference and create a checklist to verify all requirements have been met.
