# Task ID: 1
# Title: Project Setup and Architecture
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the Next.js 14 project with App Router, configure TypeScript, and set up the development environment with required dependencies.
# Details:
1. Create a new Next.js 14 project with App Router using `npx create-next-app@latest`
2. Configure TypeScript for type safety
3. Set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality
4. Install core dependencies:
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - ShadCN UI for component library
   - React Hook Form with Zod for form validation
   - SWR for data fetching
5. Configure directory structure following Next.js best practices:
   - `/app` for routes
   - `/components` for UI components
   - `/lib` for utilities
   - `/prisma` for database schema
   - `/public` for static assets
6. Set up environment variables for development
7. Configure Git repository with appropriate .gitignore

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify successful project creation and startup
2. Confirm TypeScript compilation works without errors
3. Test ESLint and Prettier configurations
4. Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and imported
5. Validate directory structure follows best practices
