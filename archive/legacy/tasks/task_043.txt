# Task ID: 43
# Title: Task #43: Implement Context-Aware JobBot API for Job-Specific Conversations
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a new /api/jobbot API endpoint that leverages OpenAI GPT-4-turbo to provide job-specific conversational responses using contextual data from job listings, FAQs, and company information.
# Details:
The implementation should include the following components:

1. Create a new API route at `/api/jobbot` that accepts POST requests with the following parameters:
   - `jobId` (required): The unique identifier for the job posting
   - `messages` (required): An array of message objects in the format expected by OpenAI's API

2. Database Integration:
   - Implement functionality to load relevant job information based on the provided jobId
   - Retrieve associated FAQs specific to the job posting
   - Load company context and details related to the job
   - Design a data structure to store job-specific training data when employers create or edit job postings

3. OpenAI Integration:
   - Set up a connection to OpenAI's API using GPT-4-turbo
   - Construct an appropriate system prompt that incorporates:
     - Job details (title, description, requirements, benefits, etc.)
     - Company information (culture, values, location, etc.)
     - Relevant FAQs and their answers
     - Any additional context that would help the model provide accurate responses

4. Response Handling:
   - Process the OpenAI API response
   - Format and return the assistant's reply to the client
   - Implement appropriate error handling for cases like invalid jobId, API failures, etc.

5. Context Management:
   - Design and implement a mechanism to store job-specific training data when employers create or edit job postings
   - Ensure this data is efficiently retrievable when needed for the jobbot conversations
   - Consider caching strategies for frequently accessed jobs to improve performance

6. Security Considerations:
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization checks
   - Validate all input parameters
   - Ensure sensitive company information is appropriately protected

7. Performance Optimization:
   - Implement request throttling if necessary
   - Consider caching strategies for OpenAI responses where appropriate
   - Optimize database queries for retrieving job context

The implementation should be modular and maintainable, with clear separation of concerns between data retrieval, prompt construction, API interaction, and response handling.

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this feature should be comprehensive and include:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Test the individual components of the API route (data retrieval, prompt construction, response handling)
   - Mock the OpenAI API calls to test different response scenarios
   - Verify proper error handling for various edge cases (invalid jobId, malformed messages, etc.)

2. Integration Tests:
   - Test the complete flow from request to response with a mock database
   - Verify that job context is correctly loaded and incorporated into the system prompt
   - Ensure the OpenAI API is called with the correct parameters

3. End-to-End Tests:
   - Create test job postings with various types of information
   - Send sample conversations to the API and verify responses are contextually relevant
   - Test with real OpenAI API calls (in a controlled environment)

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure response times under different loads
   - Test with various sizes of job context data
   - Identify potential bottlenecks in the system

5. Security Testing:
   - Verify that authentication and authorization are working correctly
   - Test for potential injection vulnerabilities
   - Ensure sensitive information is not leaked in responses

6. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Have real users interact with the jobbot for different job postings
   - Collect feedback on the quality and relevance of responses
   - Identify areas where the context could be improved

7. Specific Test Cases:
   - Test with jobs that have minimal information vs. comprehensive details
   - Test with various types of questions (about requirements, benefits, company culture, etc.)
   - Test with multi-turn conversations to verify context is maintained
   - Test with questions that should not be answerable based on the provided context

Document all test cases and results, and establish a baseline for expected performance and accuracy metrics.
