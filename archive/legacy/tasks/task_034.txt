# Task ID: 34
# Title: Task #34: Frontend: Connect 'Should I Apply' Calculator UI to Backend API
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement the frontend-backend integration for the 'Should I Apply' Calculator by connecting the existing UI to the comparison API endpoint and displaying results to users.
# Details:
This task involves integrating the previously developed 'Should I Apply' Calculator UI (Task #31) with the backend API endpoint for resume and job description comparison (Task #32). The developer should:

1. Create a service or utility function to handle API calls to the backend endpoint
2. Implement proper error handling for API requests (network errors, server errors, etc.)
3. Add loading states to the UI while waiting for API responses
4. Format and display the qualification assessment (Not Qualified, Qualified, Over Qualified) prominently in the UI
5. Present the explanatory feedback from the AI in a readable, user-friendly format
6. Consider implementing a way to save or export the results
7. Ensure the UI is responsive and accessible when displaying results
8. Add appropriate analytics tracking for result views
9. Document the integration approach for future developers

The implementation should follow the existing design system and UI patterns established in Task #31. This task is not considered high priority but should maintain high quality standards.

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this integration should include:

1. Unit tests:
   - Test API service functions with mocked responses
   - Verify error handling logic works correctly
   - Ensure loading states are properly managed

2. Integration tests:
   - Verify the UI correctly calls the API with proper parameters
   - Test that results from the API are correctly parsed and displayed
   - Confirm error messages appear appropriately when API calls fail

3. End-to-end tests:
   - Complete user flow from entering resume/job details to viewing results
   - Test with various qualification outcomes (Not Qualified, Qualified, Over Qualified)
   - Verify accessibility of the results display (screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation)

4. Manual testing:
   - Test with realistic resume and job description examples
   - Verify the UI displays results in a user-friendly manner
   - Check responsiveness on different screen sizes
   - Validate that loading indicators provide good user experience

5. User acceptance testing:
   - Have stakeholders review the integration and provide feedback
   - Collect metrics on user engagement with the results page

All tests should be documented and included in the CI/CD pipeline where appropriate.
