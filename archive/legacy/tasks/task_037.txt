2. Each remaining page should include:
   - Proper HTML structure with semantic elements
   - Page title and meta description
   - Main heading (H1)
   - Brief description of the page's purpose
   - Navigation elements consistent with established patterns
   - Footer with standard links
   - Placeholder for main content area
   - Basic responsive layout (mobile, tablet, desktop)

3. Ensure all new pages follow the established design system/components.

4. Add appropriate placeholder text indicating future functionality.

5. Include commented code sections indicating where dynamic content will be integrated.

6. Ensure all pages follow accessibility best practices even at this placeholder stage.

7. Set up proper routing for all remaining pages in the application framework.

8. Update UX_FRAMEWORK_PROGRESS.md with documentation for all newly created pages.

This task focuses on completing the structure and navigation framework while maintaining consistency with already implemented components and pages.

# Test Strategy:
To verify successful completion of this task, perform the following tests:

1. Page Existence and Structure Verification:
   - Confirm all 17+ specified pages have been created
   - Verify each page has proper HTML structure with semantic elements
   - Check that each page includes a main heading and description
   - Ensure navigation elements are present and consistent
   - Verify new pages follow established design patterns from completed pages

2. Navigation Testing:
   - Test all navigation links between pages
   - Verify breadcrumb navigation if implemented
   - Confirm no broken links exist
   - Test browser back/forward functionality
   - Verify mobile navigation works correctly across all pages

3. Responsive Design Testing:
   - Test each page at multiple viewport sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - Verify content remains accessible and readable at all sizes
   - Check that navigation adapts appropriately to different screen sizes
   - Ensure consistency with responsive patterns established in completed pages

4. Accessibility Testing:
   - Run automated accessibility checks (e.g., Lighthouse, axe)
   - Verify proper heading hierarchy
   - Check for appropriate alt text on any placeholder images
   - Test keyboard navigation between and within pages
   - Ensure color contrast meets WCAG standards across all pages

5. Code Quality Review:
   - Review HTML structure for proper semantic elements
   - Verify CSS organization follows project standards
   - Check for commented sections indicating future functionality
   - Ensure consistent naming conventions across files
   - Verify new code maintains patterns established in completed components

6. Documentation Review:
   - Verify documentation of page purposes and intended functionality
   - Check that placeholder text clearly indicates future functionality
   - Confirm routing documentation is complete
   - Review UX_FRAMEWORK_PROGRESS.md for completeness and accuracy

7. Cross-browser Testing:
   - Test pages in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Verify consistent appearance and behavior across browsers

8. Performance Baseline:
   - Run performance tests to establish baseline metrics for future comparison
   - Compare metrics with already completed pages to ensure consistency

The task is complete when all pages exist, are properly structured, navigate correctly between each other, display appropriately on all devices, meet basic accessibility standards, and maintain consistency with the established design patterns.
