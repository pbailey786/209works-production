# JobsGPT Chat Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The chat functionality on `/chat` page was not responding due to Prisma query errors caused by `mode: 'insensitive'` in PostgreSQL queries.

## Root Cause
The `buildJobQueryFromFiltersSafe` function and the deprecated `buildJobQueryFromFilters` function in the chat API both contained `mode: 'insensitive'` parameters in Prisma queries, which were causing database query failures.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed `buildJobQueryFromFiltersSafe` function
**File:** `/src/lib/job-query-builder.ts`

Removed `mode: 'insensitive'` from all string contains queries:
- Location filter (line 71)
- Company filter (line 87) 
- Industry/title filter (lines 104, 110)
- Role/title filter (line 122)
- General search terms (lines 136, 137, 138)

### 2. Fixed deprecated function in chat API
**File:** `/src/app/api/chat-job-search/route.ts`

Removed `mode: 'insensitive'` from:
- Central Valley location searches (lines 241-242)
- Location filter (line 272)
- Company filter (line 285)
- Role/title filter (line 304)
- General search terms (lines 318-320)

## Expected Result
- JobsGPT chat on `/chat` page should now respond to user queries
- Case-insensitive search will still work as PostgreSQL handles `contains` searches appropriately
- Both "warehouse" and "Warehouse" searches should return the same results
- Natural language queries like "warehouse jobs in stockton that pay over $20/hour" should work properly

## Testing Needed
1. **Test JobsGPT Chat**: Visit `/chat` page and try queries like:
   - "warehouse jobs"
   - "jobs in stockton" 
   - "warehouse jobs in modesto that pay over $20/hour"
   - Verify no more 500 errors and natural language responses are returned

2. **Test Case-Insensitive Search**: Verify mixed case searches work ("Warehouse" vs "warehouse")

3. **Test Complete Flow**: Job search → results → natural conversation flow

## Technical Notes
- PostgreSQL with Prisma handles case-insensitive searches without explicit `mode: 'insensitive'` 
- The fix maintains search functionality while resolving database compatibility issues
- Both the safe query builder and deprecated embedded function were updated for consistency
